This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox)
under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## Installing Sudo
Login as root
```bash
$ su -
```
Update apt
```bash
$ apt update
```
Install sudo
```bash
$ apt install sudo
```

## Adding user to sudo group
```bash
$ sudo usermod -aG [groupname] [username]
```
or
```bash
$ sudo adduser [username] [groupname]
```
>-a stands for (append) -G (groups)


## Creating new group

Now user has superpowers you can run sudo direct from the user and create the user42 group
```
$ sudo groupadd [groupname]
```
>Than add the user to user42 group using the previous command

## Creating new user

```bash
$ adduser [username]
```

To list all the users run this command
```bash
$ getent passwd
```

## SSH

## Install openssh-server
```bash
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
```

Verify if openssh-server was installed
```bash
$ ssh -V
#or
$ ssh -v localhost
#or
$ dpkg -l | grep ssh
```

## Adding Password complexity

## Password age

Edit this file
```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/login.defs
```
Change these lines
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS     30  - Expire date
PASS_MIN_DAYS     2   - Min days for changing
PASS_WARN_AGE     7   - Warning the user 7 days before expire
```

### Password complexity


Install password quality cheking library
```bash
$ sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```


Open the file
```bash
sudo vim /etc/pam.d/common-password
```



Add the following commands to the end of this line
```bash
password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=10 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 difok=7 reject_username enforce_for_root
```
```bash
minlen=10  - Defines the minimum password length
lcredit=-1 - Define the minimun number of lower letters
ucredit=-1 - Define the minimun number of upper letters
dcredit=-1 - Define the minimun number of special characters
difok=7 - Prevent the user to use 7 characters from the former password
reject_username - Prevent for using the username into the password
enforce_for_root  - Apply the rules for the rootpa
```
